I’m a mechanical engineering graduate with a focus on mechanical design, structural analysis, and manufacturing-informed problem solving. My work emphasizes sound fundamentals, standards-driven requirements, and practical validation through analysis, simulation, and hands-on integration.

I’m particularly interested in complex mechanical systems where design decisions are shaped by real operating conditions, manufacturability, and long-term performance.

**Featured work includes:**
- Industry-sponsored senior design involving structural sizing, FEA validation, and system integration  
- Standards-driven design (ANSI/ITSDF B56.6) for rough terrain forklift trucks and attachments  
- CAD, drawings, and GD&T supporting manufacturable assemblies
