## Overview

![FPSS carriage prototype](/assets/projects/telehandler/fpss-carriage.jpg)

This project developed a prototype FPSS carriage intended for a 12,000 lb rated-load class telehandler attachment.  
The objective was to integrate fork positioning and side-shift functionality into a single carriage while maintaining structural integrity under worst-case loading and producing a manufacturable, serviceable assembly.

The design emphasized realistic operating conditions, standards-driven load cases, and iterative validation through calculation, simulation, and hands-on assembly.

## Requirements & Constraints

Design requirements were informed by ANSI/ITSDF B56.6, governing rough-terrain forklift and telehandler attachments.

Key constraints included:

- **Structural:** Maintain acceptable safety factors under worst-case and asymmetric loading
- **Functional:** Preserve rigidity and alignment while enabling fork positioning and side-shift travel
- **Manufacturing:** Practical plate thicknesses, weldable features, serviceable pin and connection points
- **Validation:** Hand calculations supported by FEA, with sanity checks for consistency

## Engineering Approach

### 1) Load Case Definition
Load cases were developed to reflect worst-case structural demand, including lateral and asymmetric loading representative of side-shifted attachments operating at rated capacity.  
Scenarios were selected to challenge:

- Global bending and torsion of the carriage
- Stress concentrations near weldments and connections
- Pin and joint regions susceptible to localized stress and tear-out risk

### 2) Hand Calculations
Hand calculations were used to:
- Establish baseline expectations for stress and deflection
- Size critical structural members
- Identify geometry changes with the greatest influence on load paths

### 3) FEA Review & Iteration

*Representative FEA results generated by a team member using ANSYS. Results were reviewed and used to validate hand calculations and inform design iteration.*

Finite element results were reviewed to:
- Confirm global stress trends
- Identify localized hotspots
- Compare against hand-calculated expectations as a sanity check

Insights from simulation were used to guide **iterative geometry updates** and improve structural behavior.

### 4) CAD Development

CAD models were iterated alongside analysis to reflect updated geometry, load paths, and manufacturability considerations.

## Hydraulics & Electrical Integration

While the project’s primary design focus was structural, FPSS functionality required coordinated hydraulic and electrical system integration.

### Hydraulics

![Hydraulic hose routing supporting FPSS actuation](/assets/projects/telehandler/fpss-hydraulic-manifold.png)

- Sized hydraulic cylinders and hoses based on required forces, stroke, and system pressure
- Selected hose and fitting specifications compatible with available auxiliary circuits
- Integrated an existing multi-function hydraulic manifold to support independent fork positioning and side-shift control
- Routed and assembled hydraulic hoses, including cutting hoses to length and installing fittings
- Verified clearances, bend radii, and serviceability through full-range motion

### Electrical

- Evaluated electrical routing approaches (boom-mounted cable reel vs. internal cable control)
- Selected and installed a cable reel to support attachment electrical requirements
- Fabricated and installed a wiring harness interfacing with attachment controls
- Supported functional checks during final assembly

## My Role & Contributions

I contributed primarily to engineering analysis, validation, and system integration, including:

- Defining and translating governing load cases into analyzable scenarios
- Performing hand calculations to size structural members and establish baseline expectations
- Reviewing and interpreting team-generated FEA results to validate assumptions and guide iteration
- Identifying stress drivers related to geometry, load paths, and connections
- Supporting manufacturability through practical geometry and serviceability considerations
- Hands-on assembly of the prototype, including hydraulic hose routing, fitting installation, and electrical integration
