      This project developed a prototype FPSS carriage intended for a 12,000 lb rated-load class telehandler attachment.
      The objective was to integrate fork positioning and side-shift functionality into a single carriage while maintaining
      structural integrity under worst-case loading and producing a manufacturable, serviceable assembly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The design emphasized realistic operating conditions, standards-driven load cases, and iterative validation through
      calculation, simulation, and hands-on assembly.

## Requirements & Constraints

Design requirements were informed by ANSI/ITSDF B56.6, governing rough-terrain forklift and telehandler attachments.

Key constraints included:

- **Structural:** Maintain acceptable safety factors under worst-case and asymmetric loading
- **Functional:** Preserve rigidity and alignment while enabling fork positioning and side-shift travel
- **Manufacturing:** Practical plate thicknesses, weldable features, serviceable pin and connection points
- **Validation:** Hand calculations supported by FEA, with sanity checks for consistency

## Engineering Approach

### 1) Load Case Definition
Load cases were developed to reflect worst-case structural demand, including lateral and asymmetric loading representative of side-shifted attachments operating at rated capacity.  
Scenarios were selected to challenge:

- Global bending and torsion of the carriage
- Stress concentrations near weldments and connections
- Pin and joint regions susceptible to localized stress and tear-out risk

### 2) Hand Calculations
Hand calculations were used to:
- Establish baseline expectations for stress and deflection
- Size critical structural members
- Identify geometry changes with the greatest influence on load paths

### 3) FEA Review & Iteration

<div style="display:flex; gap:2rem; align-items:flex-start; flex-wrap:wrap; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
  <div style="flex: 1.2; min-width: 260px;">
    <p style="margin-top:0;">
      Finite element results were reviewed to confirm global stress trends, identify localized hotspots, and compare against
      hand-calculated expectations as a sanity check. Insights from simulation guided iterative geometry updates and improved
      structural behavior.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Confirmed global stress trends</li>
      <li>Identified localized hotspots</li>
      <li>Cross-checked results against hand calculations</li>
      <li>Used findings to drive iteration</li>
    </ul>

### 4) CAD Development

      style="width:100%; max-width:750px; border-radius:14px; display:block; margin:0 auto;"
    />
  </div>

  <div style="flex: 1.2; min-width: 260px;">
    <p style="margin-top:0;">
      CAD models were iterated alongside analysis to reflect updated geometry, load paths,
      and manufacturability considerations. Design changes were driven by identified stress
      drivers, connection behavior, and practical fabrication constraints.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Iterative geometry updates driven by analysis</li>
      <li>Clear load paths and serviceable connections</li>
      <li>Manufacturable plate geometry and weldable features</li>
    </ul>

## Hydraulics & Electrical Integration

While the project’s primary design focus was structural, FPSS functionality required coordinated hydraulic and electrical system integration.
