## Overview
Industry-sponsored senior design project focused on integrating fork positioning and side-shift functionality into a single telehandler carriage.

**Context:** Capstone Design  
**Tools:** SolidWorks, FEA, GD&T  
**Standards:** ANSI/ITSDF B56.6

---

## Problem Definition
Design a carriage capable of supporting a 12,000 lb rated load under worst-case loading conditions while remaining manufacturable and serviceable.

---

## Engineering Approach
- Defined load cases per ANSI/ITSDF B56.6
- Performed hand calculations to size structural members
- Created FEA model to validate stress and deflection
- Iterated design to address weld stress and pin tear-out risk

---

## Results
- Structural integrity maintained with acceptable safety factors
- Design validated against hand calculations
- Final CAD released for manufacturing
