  <div style="flex: 2; min-width: 280px;">
    <p>I’m a recent mechanical engineering graduate with interests in mechanical design, structural analysis, and manufacturing-focused product development. My decision to pursue mechanical engineering was driven by a genuine interest in understanding how physical systems behave. That interest has consistently pushed me toward learning beyond coursework, particularly in aerodynamics, and continues to shape the kind of engineering work I want to pursue.</p>

    <p> Much of my project experience to date has involved structural systems and heavy equipment, but my long-term interest is aerospace and high-performance engineering. I’m less focused on a specific industry label than on working with complex physical systems where sound fundamentals, thoughtful design decisions, and rigorous validation matter.
    </p>

     <p> At this stage in my career, I’m looking for an environment that emphasizes technical growth—where engineers are encouraged to ask questions, learn from experienced mentors, and take on increasing responsibility as their judgment develops. I value teams that balance analysis with practical considerations and see manufacturing and testing as integral parts of the design process.
    </p>

    <h3>What I’m looking for</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A team that values mentorship, engineering judgment, and long-term growth</li>
      <li>Mechanical design, analysis, or product development roles</li>
      <li>Exposure to manufacturing, testing, and system-level integration</li>
    </ul>
